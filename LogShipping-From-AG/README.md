# LogShipping from Availability Groups

Following are the steps to configure Log Shipping (LS) from AlwaysOn Availability Group (AG) to Stand-alone instance, by following approach when AG failover to secondary replica in a group there is no interruption to the Log Shipping as all secondaryâ€™s in LS communicate with primary on AG Listener, the configuration doesn't inlcude Monitor Server, However that can be done later using separate script file.

### Pre-Requisites 
1. Set Database Recovery Model to FULL (if not already) `ALTER DATABASE [DBNema] SET RECOVERY FULL;`
2. Take FULL and LOG Backups from Primary SQL-Instance of LS 
3. Restore WITH NORECOVERY or STANDBY option at Secondary SQL-Instance of LS
4. Stop LOG Backup Jobs at Primary Replica (If there is any exists)


### Log Shipping Configuration 
  1. Use the `LSPrimary-Configure-Without-Monitor.sql` to execute on Primary Instance of LS, following varilable values must be changed, and it shold be executed in all AG Replicas
   ```sql
SELECT @PrimaryServer      = 'SQL-LS-PRIMARY01'
SELECT @SecondaryServer    = 'SQL-LS-SECONDARY01'; -- Change it as needed 
SELECT @DBName             = 'DBName';  
SELECT @BackupDirectory    = '\\SharedHost\SharedFolder\' + @DBName; ----  This is the Backup shared location 
SELECT @BackupJobName      = 'LS_Backup_'+@DBName; 
SELECT @BackupScheduleName = 'LS_Backup_Sch_Databases'; -- This is centralized schedule for group of databases
```
  2. Verify LS Backup Jobs and Schedule in **Primary** Replicas of AG
  3. Use the `LSSecondary-Configure-Without-Monitor.sql` to execute on **Secondary** Instance of LS, following varilable values must be changed before executing script
 ```sql
SELECT	@SecondaryServer      = 'SQL-LS-SECONDARY01';
SELECT	@PrimaryServer        = 'SQL-LS-PRIMARY01'  --- Include AG Lestener name, if there is any custom port it must be specified with comma (,) after the hostname
SELECT	@DBName               = 'DBName'; 
SELECT	@BackupDirectory      = '\\SharedHost\SharedFolder\' + @DBName;
SELECT	@BackupCopyDirectory  = 'C:\LogShipping\' + @DBName; 	-- Where the Log Shipping should copy the Backups from main-backup location
SELECT	@CopyJobName          = 'LS_Copy_'+@DBName;
SELECT	@CopyScheduleName     = 'CopyJobSchedule_'+@DBName;
SELECT	@RestoreJobName       = 'LS_Restore_'+@DBName;
SELECT	@RestoreScheduleName  = 'RestoreJobSchedule' + @DBName;
```
  4. Verify LS Backup Jobs and Schedule in **Secondary** SQL-Instance of LS
  5. Run SQL Jobs in following order 
        
        LS-Backup Job     at **Primary** (In which replica of AG the backups preferred)
        
        LS-Copy Job       at **Secondary** SQL-Instance of LS
        
        LS-Restore Job    at **Secondary** SQL-Instance of LS
